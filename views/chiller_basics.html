<h3>What is a chiller and how does it work?</h3>

<p>Chillers and air conditioners use one or more forms of energy to move thermal energy from one place to another thereby making one side colder and the other side hotter. Most chillers are based on using mechanical work with a working fluid (the refrigerant) to move thermal energy; however chillers can also be chemical, thermoelectric, thermoacoustic, or magnocaloric.</p> 
    
<p>Vapor compression based chillers or refrigeration systems are based on moving a working fluid or refrigerant around a cycle comprised of four main components: compressor, condenser, expansion device, and evaporator. The compressor moves the refrigerant around the cycle and added work (energy) to the vapor phase of the refrigerant by compressing it. The condenser rejects the heat from the hot vapor and condenses the refrigerant to a liquid. The expansion device allows a controlled expansion of the “hot” liquid refrigerant, which lowers its temperature and the evaporator is used to transfer heat from the area that is being cooled to the refrigerant. </p>
