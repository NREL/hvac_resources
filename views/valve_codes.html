<div class="myh2">Codes and Standards</div>

<p>Testing standards are important for valves, mainly to understand leakage amount
  of a given valve type. Leakage allowances are more critical in the petroleum industry
  but nevertheless equally important for central plants. Few standards for valve leakage
  testing are given below. </p>

  <p> <span class="myh3bold" >ANSI Standard FCI 70-2: </span>  <span class="myh3">Control Valve Seat Leakage by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI)</span></p>
  <p>	&middot; Defines a range of six leakage classes for control valves and their testing procedure.
  <p>	&middot; Outlines leakage rate in ml/min and bubbles/min for a range of nominal port diameters.
  <p>	&middot; Most commonly used standard for hot/cold valve applications.

  <p> <span class="myh3bold" >ISO standard 5208: </span>  <span class="myh3">Industrial valves - Pressure testing of metallic valves by the International organization for standardization (ISO)</span></p>
  <p>	&middot; Outlines different pressure tests and class types for valve types such as globe, plug, check, diaphragm and butterfly.
  <p>	&middot; Leakage rate specified in mm3/sec and drops/sec for different rate types.

  <p>	&middot; No visible leakage permitted.
  <p>	&middot; Allowable leakage table for liquids and gases depending on valve size.

  <p>	&middot; Designed mainly for fully open/closed valves. Not control valves.
  <p>	&middot; Leakage rate specified in cc/hr for difference nominal pipe diameter.
