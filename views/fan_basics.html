<p>The chosen fan should be able to meet the required airflow/pressure while adhering to design constraints of space and acoustic requirements. A study by LBNL and U.S. DOE estimated the parasitic energy consumption (i.e. energy required to distribute heating and cooling inside a building, heat rejection and ventilation) in commercial buildings to be 1.5 quads. Out of total parasitic load, supply fans consumed 50% of the energy. Thus AHU fan selection can have a major impact on the overall energy consumption, especially when it comes to estimating the static pressure for the fan. Details of efficient fan selection are elaborated in the fan design guide section. </p>

<p><span class="myh3">Where are fans and blowers used?</span></p>
<p></p>Fans and blowers are used in many industrial and commercial applications including HVAC systems. They comprise a substantial portion of the electricity used in HVAC systems in the US. The most common commercial HVAC systems all have one or more fans:  RTUs, CAV systems, VAV systems. In addition, fans and blowers are needed for ventilation and air quality as well as space conditioning. Fans are also used in HVAC condensers and cooling towers.</p>
