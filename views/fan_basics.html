<p>Fans are the principle mechanism for moving air in buildings and play an essential role in maintaining comfortable and healthy
  indoor environments and cooling equipment. Fans consume approximately 139 billion kWh of electricity annually<sup>1</sup>  or approximately 25%
  of the HVAC electrical energy in commercial buildings<sup>2</sup>. Significant energy savings and performance enhancement opportunities are available
  through proper selection, system design, and operational practices. For example, adding a variable speed drive to a constant speed fan can
  reduce energy consumption by over 50% in the right applications.</p>

<p>
There are two basic types of fans â€“ axial and centrifugal. Axial fans move air along the axis of the fan using the aerodynamic lift of the spinning
fan blades. Centrifugal fans use centrifugal force to turn kinetic energy in to pressure in the air stream. Centrifugal fans are the most common fans
in HVAC systems. Propeller axial fans are good at moving large volumes of air at low pressures. Vaneaxial fans can provide high pressures and good flow
and can be used interchangeably with centrifugal fans in some HVAC applications.</p>
