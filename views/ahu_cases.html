<a class="doctitle" href="http://www.dac-hvac.com/wp-content/uploads/Coil-Cleaning-Saves-Energy-Study.pdf" target="_blank">34-floor building on Times Square in New York city</a>
    
<br>This study involved cleaning the coils of two AHUs with cooling capacities of 121 tons and 81 tons respectively. There were four AHUs in total, serving an area of 1.2 million ft2. The coils of the AHU under study were 30 years old. The study resulted in:</p>
<ul class="mylist">
<li>An estimated energy savings of up to $40,000 for the first year </li>
<li>A decrease in the pressure drop across the coil of approximately 14% </li>
<li>An increase in tonnage of 19â€“20 tons to the 81 ton AHU </li>
<li>An increase in thermal efficiency of 25% for sensible heat load and 10% for latent load.</li>

    </ul>
