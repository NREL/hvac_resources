</span>
<br>Study comprised of cleaning coils of 2 AHU’s with cooling capacity of 121 tons and 81 tons respectively. There were 4 AHU’s in total serving an area of 1.2 million ft2. The coils of the AHU under study were 30 years old. The results from the study concluded </p>
<ul class="mylist">
       <li>An estimated energy saving up to $40,000 for the first year.</li>
       <li>A decrease in the pressure drop across the coil of approximately 14%.</li>
       <li>An increase in tonnage of 19-20 tons to the 81 ton AHU.</li>
       <li>Increase in thermal efficiency by 25% for sensible heat load and 10% for latent load.</li>
    </ul>
