<p>Periodic evaluation of air handler is recommended to identify efficiency measures. The evaluation generally consists of a combination of on-site observations and a more detailed testing of AHU components. The <a class="doctitle" href="http://www.nrel.gov/docs/gen/fy11/50134.pdf" target="_blank">‘General Air Handling Unit’</a> checklist published by NREL lists a number of measures to save energy in commercial buildings by improving the operational efficiency of AHU. These measures are summarized below. Refer to <a class="doctitle" href="http://www.nrel.gov/docs/gen/fy11/50134.pdf" target="_blank">‘General Air Handling Unit Checklist’</a> for more information.</p>

<p>	&middot;  Verifying proper operation of air dampers</p>
<p>	&middot;  Verifying proper operation of air-side economizer</p>
<p>	&middot;  Verifying proper operation of heating and cooling valves</p>
<p>	&middot;  Checking the condition of heating and cooling coils and AHU filters</p>
<p>	&middot;  Identifying and eliminating duct leakage</p>
<p>	&middot;  Eliminating 100% outside air systems in applications where 100% fresh air is not needed</p>
<p>	&middot;  Reducing outside air flow rate to ASHRAE 62.1 recommended values</p>
<p>	&middot;  Implementing HVAC system night setback schedule</p>
<p>	&middot;  Tracking HVAC setback schedule</p>
<p>	&middot;  Monitoring exhaust fan controls</p>
<p>	&middot;  Operating systems at part load during unoccupied hours</p>
<p>	&middot;  Converting constant volume systems to variable volume</p>
<p>	&middot;  Resetting the supply air temperature </p>

<p>Heat transfer effectiveness of the coil is reduced due to fouling. This in turn increases the water flow rate and reduces the delta-T. Chemical treatment is
   recommended to control fouling. </p>
