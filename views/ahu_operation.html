<p>Periodic evaluation of air handlers is recommended to identify efficiency measures. The evaluation generally consists of a combination of on-site observations and a
  more detailed testing of air handling unit (AHU) components. The  <a class="doctitle" href="http://www.nrel.gov/docs/gen/fy11/50134.pdf" target="_blank">General Air
    Handling Unit Checklist</a> published by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory lists a number of measures to save energy in commercial buildings by improving the
    operational efficiency of AHUs. These measures are summarized below; refer to the <a class="doctitle" href="http://www.nrel.gov/docs/gen/fy11/50134.pdf" target="_blank">
      General Air Handling Unit Checklist</a> for more information:</p>
<ul class="mylist">
  <li> Verifying proper operation of air dampers </li>
  <li> Verifying proper operation of air-side economizer</li>
  <li> Verifying proper operation of heating and cooling valves</li>
  <li> Checking the condition of heating and cooling coils and AHU filters</li>
  <li> Identifying and eliminating duct leakage</li>
  <li> Eliminating 100% outside air systems in applications where 100% fresh air is not needed</li>
  <li> Reducing outside airflow rate to ASHRAE 62.1 recommended values</li>
  <li> Implementing HVAC system night setback schedule</li>
  <li> Tracking HVAC setback schedule</li>
  <li> Monitoring exhaust fan controls</li>
  <li> Operating systems at part load during unoccupied hours</li>
  <li> Converting constant volume systems to variable volume</li>
  <li> Resetting the supply air temperature.</li>

    </ul>

<p>Heat transfer effectiveness of the coil is reduced due to fouling. This in turn increases the water flow rate and reduces the delta-T. Chemical treatment is recommended
   to control fouling. </p>
