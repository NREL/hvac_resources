<p>Periodic evaluation of air handler is recommended to identify efficiency measures. The evaluation generally consists of a combination of on-site observations and a more detailed testing of AHU components. The <a class="doctitle" href="http://www.nrel.gov/docs/gen/fy11/50134.pdf" target="_blank">‘General Air Handling Unit’</a> checklist published by NREL lists a number of measures to save energy in commercial buildings by improving the operational efficiency of AHU. These measures are summarized below. Refer to <a class="doctitle" href="http://www.nrel.gov/docs/gen/fy11/50134.pdf" target="_blank">‘General Air Handling Unit Checklist’</a> for more information.</p>
<ul class="mylist">
<li>Verifying proper operation of air dampers</li>
<li>Verifying proper operation of air-side economizer</li>
<li>Verifying proper operation of heating and cooling valves</li>
<li>Checking the condition of heating and cooling coils and AHU filters</li>
<li>Identifying and eliminating duct leakage</li>
<li>Eliminating 100% outside air systems in applications where 100% fresh air is not needed</li>
<li>Reducing outside air flow rate to ASHRAE 62.1 recommended values</li>
<li>Implementing HVAC system night setback schedule</li>
<li>Tracking HVAC setback schedule</li>
<li>Monitoring exhaust fan controls</li>
<li>Operating systems at part load during unoccupied hours</li>
<li>Converting constant volume systems to variable volume</li>
<li>Resetting the supply air temperature</li>
    </ul>

<p>Heat transfer effectiveness of the coil is reduced due to fouling. This in turn increases the water flow rate and reduces the delta-T. Chemical treatment is
   recommended to control fouling. </p>
