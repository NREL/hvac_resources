<p>
Efficiency of a boiler is measured by the Annual fuel utilization efficiency (AFUE). It is the ratio of useful energy output to the energy input. This metric
is similar to the seasonal energy efficiency rating (SEER) for air-conditioners, in the sense that it does not represent efficiency at one point but it does over a season.
Minimum levels of AFUE are outlined by the ANSI/ASHRAE standard 90.1 2016 for different boiler/fuel types across different sizes . </p>

Refer the 'efficiency requirements' section in the Boiler Procurement and performance tab of this resource for more details.
