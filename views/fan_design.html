In depth discussion about variable air volume system design, best practices and component design considerations:
 “Advanced Variable Air Volume VAV System Design Guide” Energy Design Resources December 2009. http://energydesignresources.com/media/2651/EDR_DesignGuidelines_VAV.pdf?tracked=true

Advanced VAV system design guidance with comparison table for common fan types: 
“Design Brief: Advanced Variable-Air-Volume (VAV) Systems” Energy Design Resources, May 2010.

Description of the Fan Efficiency Grade (FEG) for classifying fan energy efficiency potential. The FEG is incorporated into ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2013 to specify minimum fan efficiency requirements.
AMCA International “The Role of Fan Efficiency in Reducing HVAC Energy Consumption” Spring 2010.

Introduction to the Fan Efficiency Ratio (FER) metric for evaluating fan efficiency relative to a baseline efficiency both at a single airflow and pressure. 
AMCA International “Introducing Fan Efficiency Ratios” http://www.amca.org/resources/FER_Whitepaper_single%20pages.pdf

Explains quantitative advantages of using variable frequency devices (VFD) also called variable speed devices (VSD).
Danfoss “VLT® HVAC Drive Design Guide” Deals with VFD system design. http://www.danfoss.com/nr/rdonlyres/7b7cd91b-9c60-45cb-91b8-f448e7b401a5/0/fc102_designguide_1101400kw_mg16c102.pdf

Discusses the effect of inlet and outlet connections on fan performance. It includes separate axial fan factors and is aimed primarily at the designer of the air moving system AMCA “Fan and Air System Applications Handbook (AMCA Fan Application Manual)”.
