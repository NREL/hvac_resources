<p>Designing and installing high performing fan systems is a good first step, but to ensure intended performance is obtained and sustained, system commissioning and ongoing maintenance is required.  Testing and balancing of air systems also matches installed equipment to design intent and reduces energy use by improperly balanced systems.</p>
