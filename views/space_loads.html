    <p>The primary purpose of HVAC systems is to provide healthy and comfortable conditioning of the occupied spaces in buildings. HVAC systems are designed and operated to meet the thermal loads of all the occupied spaces in buildings. It makes logical sense that minimizing and managing the space thermal loads is the first place to start when looking for energy savings. Itâ€™s important for the engineer to understand the space loads and determine if there are opportunities to minimize loads or if thermal conditioning requirements are underserved. Working backwards from the spaces allows the engineers and operators to properly design and operate the HVAC systems to meet the thermal conditioning requirement with the lowest energy consumption. </p>
