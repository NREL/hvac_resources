<p>The key components of AHU design are fan, coil and filter selection and air distribution system design. The fan should be able to meet the required airflow/pressure while adhering to design constraints of space and acoustic requirement. A <a class="doctitle" href="http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/publications/pdfs/commercial_initiative/hvac_volume2_final_report.pdf" target="_blank">study by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) and U.S. Department of Energy (DOE></a> estimated the parasitic energy consumption (i.e. energy required to distribute heating and cooling inside a building, heat rejection and ventilation) in commercial buildings to be 1.5 quads. <b>Out of total parasitic load, supply fans consumed 50% of the energy. Thus AHU fan selection can have major impact on overall energy consumption.</b> Details of efficient fan selection are elaborated in the fan category.</p>

<p>Periodic evaluation of air handler is recommended to identify efficiency measures. The evaluation generally consists of a combination of on-site observations and a more detailed testing of AHU components. The <a class="doctitle" href="http://www.nrel.gov/docs/gen/fy11/50134.pdf" target="_blank">‘General Air Handling Unit’</a> checklist published by NREL lists a number of measures to save energy in commercial buildings by improving the operational efficiency of AHU. These measures are summarized below. Refer to <a class="doctitle" href="http://www.nrel.gov/docs/gen/fy11/50134.pdf" target="_blank">‘General Air Handling Unit Checklist’</a> for more information.</p>
