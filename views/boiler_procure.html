<div class="myh2">Procurement and performance</div>

<div class="myh3">General</div>
<p>
  The purpose of this document is to help owners understand the key aspects of boiler energy efficiency and enable them to include appropriate language in the RFP to facilitate procurement of a boiler(s) with the desired features and efficiency levels while staying within their budget. The RFP format can also be used to engage in discussion with Engineering design firms to help select a firm that will provide design documents for appropriate high-efficiency boiler systems.<br>
  Efficiency requirements section compares boiler efficiencies across different references and lists good and best performance for boilers. 
</p>

<div class="myh3">Questions  to ask during evaluation and selection process:</div>
<span class="source">
    <ol>
      <li>Why do you want to do a boiler replacement?</li>
      <p>Is the problem at the boiler level or a system level? Answering this question helps understand the bigger picture of your hot water or steam system and possibly avoid a like-for-like replacement. </p>

      <li>What is the return water temperature of the hot water system and delta T  across the boiler? </li>
      <p>Efficiency of a commercial boiler is closely tied to the return water temperature. If you are considering using condensing boilers, the return water temperature needs to be lower than 130 °F. If the return water temperature is greater than 130 °F, flue gases will not condense and the condensing boiler will not perform as expected. <br>
         If return water temperature is greater than 130 F, consider system evaluation that could determine if modifications could be made to reduce the water temperature required by the system.  Alternately, a hybrid combination of condensing and non-condensing boilers could be used with the condensing boiler heating return water up to 130 F and conventional boiler heating supply water up to required higher temperature.
       </p>

      <li>Does the boiler system have supply water temperature reset? </li>
      <p>Supply water temperature reset helps meet the required load by reducing the boiler supply water temperature to the lowest possible. This is typically applicable when boiler system is used for building heat and reset based on outside air temperature.</p>

      <li>Is your application suited for a large boiler design or multiple modular units? </li>
      <p>Is there a distinct swing in the heating load? If yes, then over what time scale is the swing occurring ? If it is over a day, then modular boiler might be a better choice than a large boiler. Work with the designer/vendor to get a price comparison between modular and large boiler. </p>

      <li>What is the hot water load profile for your application? </li>
      <p>Unless the hot water load is constant throughout the year, or provides heating to a process requiring a constant hot water temperature, you should consider having a supply water reset function and modulation burners in the boiler. Supply water temperature reset function can improve energy by around 5 % while modulating firing rate can improve fuel efficiency by 3%.

      <li>What incentives are available in your area for improving boiler system efficiency? </li>
      <p>Some utilities offer various financial incentives to promote efficiency in boiler systems. These incentives might help in offsetting additional upfront cost for high efficiency equipment. Refer the <a class="doctitle" href="https://library.cee1.org/sites/default/files/library/7543/CEE_ComBoilerSystems_InitiativeDescription_2015_FINAL.pdf " target="_blank">CEE 2016 Commercial Boiler   Systems Program Summary </a> for more details.   </p>

      <li>Has a heat load calculation been performed for the system? </li>
      <p>Oversized boilers are a major concern for hot water systems. Although redundancy and future expansion needs to be taken into account while sizing the boiler, an oversized boiler designed completely on “rules of thumb” can lead to short-cycling and a loss of efficiency in the range of 10-15%. Requesting for a heat–load calculation in your RFP (without increasing paperwork) will ensure that boiler systems are designed within a reasonable factor of safety. (Source: <a class="doctitle" href="http://aceee.org/files/proceedings/2012/data/papers/0193-000128.pdf", target="_blank">Donnell 2012</a>) </p>

      <li>Will the manufacturer or supplier provide operations training and tune-up the system? </li>
      <p>Building operators/ facility management staff need to understand the different features of the equipment and know how to operate it. Not doing this critical piece of training many a times nullifies the energy savings that is expected out of the equipment as it does not get operated in the way it was designed to. Tune-up is another important step that needs to be done to ensure the equipment is operating per design. <br>
          Refer the ‘operation and training’ section  of the central plant resource map for more details about tune-up. Requesting for operations training and tune-up from the manufacturer  in the RFP can help in reducing post installation inefficiencies due to poor operation  .
      </p>

      <li>Is redundancy in heating systems desired?   </li>
      <p>Due to potential damage caused by loss of heating system, consider boiler system that include redundant components.  Often time this can also improve performance for example provide two (2) boilers each sized at 60 percent capacity.  Loss of one boiler would allow remaining system to maintain temperatures above critical levels.  This also helps avoid oversizing single boiler previously mentioned.    </p>

      <li>Does the boiler system generate steam?</li>
      <p>For steam boiler systems important criteria along with capacity is the steam pressure required by the heating system, humidification system or process.  Typically heating systems require low pressure steam less than 15 psig.  </p>

      <li>Will the entire heating distribution system be assessed as part of boiler replacement?</li>
      <p>Consideration should be given for the heat distribution system.  Efficiency gains and cost savings can be made by modifications to the distribution system.  With hydronic systems, pumping energy can be reduced by adding adjustable speed pumping systems with appropriate controls.  Conversion from three way valves with bypass to two way valves will allow variable flow to maximize cost savings.     </p>

<div class="myh3">Efficiency requirements</div>
<p>
  The references widely cited for boiler efficiency levels are the Department of Energy (DOE) Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) efficiency requirements, ASHRAE Standard 90.1 and ASHRAE Standard 189.1. As a preliminary reference, Table 1 gives a comparison of boiler efficiencies across these three references. Minimum efficiencies required by FEMP is the most stringent followed by ASHRAE Standard 189.1 and ASHRAE Standard 90.1. </p>

  Although FEMP, ASHRAE 189.1 and 90.1 are widely used, the Consortium for Energy Efficiency (CEE) efficiency tiers are   more closely aligned with utility incentives. Per a <a class ="doctitle" href="https://library.cee1.org/content/cee-2015-commercial-boiler-systems-program-summary/ " target="_blank">survey done by CEE</a>, there were around 60 voluntary programs in the U.S. promoting efficient boiler systems in 2015.</p>
<p>  Boilers shall meet or exceed the efficiency levels of <a class = "doctitle" href="https://library.cee1.org/sites/default/files/library/7543/CEE_ComBoilerSystems_InitiativeDescription_2015_FINAL.pdf " target="_blank">CEE Tier 0 performance specification.</a>  The boilers must be tested to BTS-2000 standards in the US.

<p> <sup>+</sup> Although turndown rates as high as 35:1 are available, turndown rates higher than 10:1 can cause greater losses from the significantly increased excess air level at low firing and not allow condensation due to small delta T (Source: <a class="doctitle" href="https://library.cee1.org/content/cee-2015-commercial-boiler-systems-program-summary/" target="_blank"> CEE</a>)</p>
