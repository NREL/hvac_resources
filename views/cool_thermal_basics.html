<span class="myh2">Cool Thermal Energy Storage: Basics</span>

<p>Thermal energy storage is a method of storing heating or cooling thermal energy by running equipment at off-peak hours. Ice, water, and phase change material
    are some commonly used storage media. Cool storage systems are most suitable for applications in which:
    <ul class="mylist">
        <li>Peak total cooling load of the facility is significantly higher than the average load</li>
        <li>Utilityâ€™s electric rate structure has high demand charges, ratchet charges, or a significant difference between on-peak and off-peak rates </li>
        <li>Facility is considering expanding cooling capacity </li>
        <li>An existing storage tank is available </li>
        <li>Redundancy in cooling systems is needed to make up for short-term cooling requirement.</li>
    </ul>
