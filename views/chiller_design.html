<p>The guide proposes a life cycle cost based approach of selecting chillers. These steps include:</p>
<p>1. Calculating the cooling load to be met by the central plant.</p>
<p>2. Short listing chiller manufacturers based on experience from previous installations and local representation.</p>
<p>3. Requesting chiller bids based on performance specifications.</p>
<p>4. Incorporating first cost impact into the bids.</p>
<p>5. Estimating energy usage of each chiller in the bid through a detailed computer model of the building/plant.</p>
<p>6. Evaluating maintenance cost for each manufacturer.</p>
<p>7. Calculating life-cycle cost analysis.</p>
<p>8. Selecting chiller with the lowest life-cycle cost analysis.</p>

<div class="myh3">Energy Efficiency Measures</div>

<p>Chiller efficiency measures are critical in the overall efficiency of the central plant. The commonly used metrics to measure efficiency are Integrated Part Load Value (IPLV), Full load efficiency (kW/ton) and coefficient of performance (COP). The part load performance of the chiller is equally important as the performance at peak load because generally, the chiller operates at peak load only for a short period during the year. Keeping such scenarios in mind, the cooling load profile needs to be thoroughly evaluated before specifying the tonnage for the chillers. A system in which chillers are staged such that the units come on as the load increases, operates more efficiently than a system with large sized chillers operating at partial load.</p>

<p>Chiller efficiency can also be improved by:</p>
<p>	&middot; Lowering chiller lift by raising the chilled water temperature.</p> 
<p>	&middot;Lowering condenser water temperature. In order to do so, the chiller must be capable of operating without triggering a low oil pressure alarm.</p>
<p>	&middot; Reducing scaling/fouling over heat transfer surfaces.</p> 
<p>	&middot; Purging air trapped in condenser.</p>
<p>	&middot; Cleaning filters on condenser water line and ensuring adequate condenser water flow.</p>
<p>	&middot; Installing variable frequency drives (VFDâ€™s) on the compressor motor of centrifugal chillers.</p>
<p>	&middot; Enabling chilled water reset.</p>
