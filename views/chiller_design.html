<p>Per ASHRAE equipment life expectancy chart, the typical life span of a chiller is 20-23 years. Thus the decisions made during design and procurement have long term impacts. Design aspects to consider include: performance, capacity and number of chillers, redundancy needs, compressor type, water cooled or air cooled, space and weight, refrigerant, maintenance requirements, sound levels, and thermal energy storage. When specifying chiller capacity and efficiency levels it is important to understand the annual load profile and knowing that the part load performance is often more important than the full load performance because chillers generally operate partial load. </p>

<a class="doctitle" href="http://www.taylor-engineering.com/Websites/taylorengineering/images/guides/EDR_DesignGuidelines_CoolToolsChilledWater.pdf" target="_blank">The Chilled Water Plant Design Guide</a> was written by Taylor Engineering as part of the CoolTools from energydesignresources. 
This guide provides a complete overview of setting up a chilled water plant from the design process through procurement and commissioning. The guide is written for engineers who design, redesign, or retrofit chilled water plants. The guide also provides a good introduction and overview for owners, facility managers, and operators.
The guide proposes a life cycle cost based approach of selecting chillers. These steps include:
<ol>
    <li>Calculating the cooling load to be met by the central plant.  </li>
    <li>Short listing chiller manufacturers based on experience from previous installations and local representation.</li>
    <li>Requesting chiller bids based on performance specifications</li>
    <li>Incorporating first cost impact into the bids</li>
    <li>Estimating energy usage of each chiller in the bid through a detailed computer model of the building/plant</li>
    <li>Evaluating maintenance cost for each manufacturer</li>
    <li>Calculating life-cycle cost analysis</li>
    <li>Selecting chiller with the lowest life-cycle cost analysis</li>
</ol>

<div class="myh3">Efficiency Measures</div>
<p>Chilled water plants are composed of several pieces of equipment and efficient operation depends on maintaining the performance of all of the equipment and on optimal coordination of the components.   
Chilled water plant efficiency can be improved with the following actions:
    <ul>
        <li>Lower chiller lift by raising the chilled water temperature set point </li>
        <li>Lower condenser water temperature. In order to do so, the chiller must be capable of operating without triggering a low oil pressure alarm </li>
        <li>Implement an aggressive water treatment program to reduce scaling/fouling over heat transfer surfaces </li>
        <li>Maintain proper refrigerant charge</li>
        <li>Purg air trapped in condenser</li>
        <li>Clean filters on condenser water line and ensuring adequate condenser water flow</li>
        <li>Install variable frequency drives (VFDâ€™s) on the compressor motor of centrifugal chillers and primary loop pumps</li>
        <li>Enable chilled water temperature reset</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>Prior to implementing chiller efficiency measures, impact to total system energy use and effectiveness should be evaluated. For example raising chilled water temperature may increase water flow rate required and increase pumping energy use.  Also, heat transfer medium such as cooling coils must be designed to produce required capacity at the higher chilled water temperature.</p>
