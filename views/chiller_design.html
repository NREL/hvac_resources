This guide provides a complete overview of setting up a chilled water plant from the design process through procurement and commissioning. The guide is written for engineers who design, redesign, or retrofit chilled water plants. The guide also provides a good introduction and overview for owners, facility managers, and operators.</p>
<p>This guide provides a complete overview of setting up a chilled water plant from the design process through procurement and commissioning. The guide is written for engineers who design, redesign, or retrofit chilled water plants. The guide also provides a good introduction and overview for owners, facility managers, and operators.</p>
<p>The guide proposes a life cycle cost based approach of selecting chillers. These steps include</p>
<p>1. Calculating the cooling load to be met by the central plant.</p>
<p>2. Short listing chiller manufacturers based on experience from previous installations and local representation.</p>
<p>3. Requesting chiller bids based on performance specifications.</p>
<p>4. Incorporating first cost impact into the bids.</p>
<p>5. Estimating energy usage of each chiller in the bid through a detailed computer model of the building/plant.</p>
<p>6. Evaluating maintenance cost for each manufacturer.</p>
<p>7. Calculating life-cycle cost analysis.</p>
<p>8. Selecting chiller with the lowest life-cycle cost analysis.</p>
