<div class="myh2">Laboratory Ventilation Effectiveness: Computational Fluid Dynamics &lpar;CFD&rpar;</div>

<p>Real time measurements of all the parameters that affect the performance of laboratory ventilation effectiveness including the airflow patterns and the resulting flow path of contaminants is not feasible, if not impossible. In such situations Computational Fluid Dynamics &lpar;CFD&rpar; analysis provides a sound scientific alternative. CFD is a science that deals with the simulation and analysis of fluid flow, heat transfer, mass transfer, and other similar transport processes. CFD is based on laws of Physics such as conservation of mass, momentum, and energy. CFD has been routinely employed in a wide of variety of industrial applications ranging from aerospace to automotive, and data centers to competitive sports. CFD simulations yield a wealth of information, including, but not limited to time-varying three dimensional &lpar;3D&rpar; distributions of air velocity, pressure, temperature, chemical concentrations, and plume dispersion, for example. This information can guide the HVAC design and help develop efficient and effective design of laboratory ventilation systems. CFD simulations help in visualization of airflow patterns and flow path of contaminants in a 3D space. Such analyses if performed at the early stages of the design can help in identifying potential pitfalls in the HVAC design and help to develop mitigation strategies. Ultimately, these analyses can avoid expensive and time-consuming retrofits after the commissioning and occupancy. CFD analysis can be a valuable tool in designing and optimizing the laboratory ventilation systems and in creating safe, energy efficient, and sustainable laboratories of the next century.</p>

<span class="myh3">CFD Analysis of a Laboratory – A Case Study</span>
<p>A recent CFD study of a typical laboratory space indicated that the contaminant distribution can be highly non-uniform despite of the “well mixed” airflow patterns. Such non-uniformity especially in the breathing zone can expose occupants to various degrees of health risks. This analysis showed occupants closer to the exhaust grille can be exposed to a higher level contaminant concentration than those closer to the source of contaminants. Furthermore, this study indicated that monitoring of the laboratory environment using concentration levels in the exhaust duct can compromise the safety of occupants. Due to highly non-uniform nature of the contaminant distribution, monitoring in the exhaust duct may underestimate the chemical exposure &lpar;dose&rpar; for some occupants. However, a simple modification such as an addition of an extra exhaust grille can significantly affect the contaminant distribution in the space resulting in reduced contaminant concentration levels and lower chemical exposure &lpar;dose&rpar; of occupants. Another CFD study emphasized that the design of HVAC system can more significantly influence the contaminant exposure levels than just air changes per hour &lpar;ACH&rpar;. Under certain circumstances high ACH can pose higher risk of chemical exposure than low ACH. It showed that CFD analysis can be employed to analyze and compare ventilation effectiveness of various HVAC designs. </p>

<span class="myh3">Spread Index &lpar;SI&rpar; – A Measure of Ventilation Effectiveness for Laboratories &lpar;VEL&rpar;</span>
<p>A laboratory ventilation system should limit the spread of contaminants and quickly purge the chemicals from a lab space to bring the concentrations below certain acceptable level determined by EH&S personnel and regulatory guidelines. The spread of contaminants is a volumetric phenomenon which is not limited to a few points in a laboratory space. Spread Index &lpar;SI&rpar; is a CFD based ventilation effectiveness which quantifies the extent the lab volume occupied by an unacceptable level of concentration which is presumably the high risk concentration threshold &lpar;TC&rpar;. Spread Index helps in visualizing spread of contaminants in a 3D lab space, and further helps in optimizing the design and operation of laboratory ventilation system to maximize ventilation effectiveness.</p>

<p>Analysis of Spread Index &lpar;SI&rpar; for a typical ventilation dominated laboratory space indicated the volume of the room occupied the chemical vapors above certain threshold concentration level increases with the release/evaporation of the chemicals, reaches its peak until the release is stopped, and then, shows sharp decline. The Purge Time &lpar;PT&rpar; – the time required to bring the concentration levels below certain acceptable threshold depends on the nature of the contaminant distribution. It would take longer to clear the trapped vapors in the space such as between the cabinets and beams. However, just addition of an extra exhaust grill can significantly reduce the levels of Spread Index &lpar;SI&rpar;.</p>


<span class="myh3">Steps for Airflow Management Analysis</span>
<p>The following procedure is mostly related to ventilation dominated labs; however, those can be applied to cooling load and fume hood dominated labs.</p>
<ul class="mylist">
    <li>Perform the risk analysis and identify worst scenarios for the high-risk contaminant, its associated generation rate, and a typical location for the release of the contaminant.</li>
    <li>Determine a typical layout of a lab including the furniture layout to identify possible obstructions to airflow, locations of supply and return, and probable locations where occupants would routinely be present.</li>
    <li>Determine the required minimum ventilation supply air rate based on the dilution theory without adding any safety factors.</li>
    <li>Perform CFD analysis to optimize spread index and minimize occupant exposure.</li>
    <li>In the case of cooling load dominated laboratories, follow ASHRAE 55 thermal comfort indices &lpar;PMV and PPD&rpar; to determine the thermal comfort of occupants. Please note the CFD analysis should reveal the hot and cold zones in a space with a distribution of PMV and PPD. The goal of the ventilation system is to maximize the thermal comfort of occupants in the occupied zone.</li>
    <li>Perform similar analysis with different number, location, and type of supply diffusers and number and location of return grilles.</li>
    <li>After performing the above optimization analysis, if required, increase the supply airflow rate to the next level.</li>
</ul>
