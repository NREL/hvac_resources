<div class="myh2">Case Study</div>

<p><a class="doctitle" href="http://energy.gov/eere/amo/downloads/new-water-booster-pump-system-reduces-energy-consumption-80-percent-and-increases" target="_blank">General Motors Pontiac Operations Complex in Pontiac, Michigan</a>
    <br>
The facility replaced five 60- to 100-horsepower pumps with three 15-horsepower variable frequency drive pumps. This resulted in a 80% reduction in pumping energy consumption and an annual saving of $11,225 with a payback of 4 years.
