<p class="myh3">Design Guide</p>
The first step in designing a cooling tower is to determine the type of cooling tower for the given site and application. Once this is locked down, calculations need to be done to for condenser water flow rate to ensure the cooling tower meets the required capacity. This is done by taking into account the wet-bulb temperature, air velocity and height of the cooling tower.
General rule of thumb is 3 gpm of recirculating flow per ton of cooling at 10°F ΔT. Evaporation is estimated at 1.8 gallons/hour per ton of cooling. Follow-up calculation to estimate make-up volume, cycles of concentration and blowdown volume can be found in this article on water use in cooling tower. 
Few additional things to be specified while designing a cooling tower are

<p class="myh3">Energy Efficiency Measures</p>
<p>	&middot; Operating CT with smaller approach. Year round operating systems reap maximum benefit.</p>
<p>	&middot; Install VFD on cooling tower fan. In mild climates, the chiller operates at part load for a major portion of the year.</p>
<p>	&middot; Periodically inspect equipment down the chilled water loop such as air handler coil. Inefficient operation of AHU increases cooling load on the chiller, in turn affecting the cooling tower.</p>

<p class="doctitle">Sub-Metering</p>
<p>Sub-metering make-up and blowdown water lines helps to estimate if appropriate amount of water is being used to do the required task. </p>

<p class="doctitle">Increase Cycles of Concentration</p>
<p>Cooling towers typically operate at a blow-down of two to three cycles. This can be increased to upto six or more cycles depending on water quality, presence of automation and constant monitoring. For additional information on how to maximize C.O.C refer <a class="doctitle" href="http://www3.epa.gov/watersense/commercial/docs/watersense_at_work/#/198/" target="_blank">6-13 of WaterSense at Work</a> and page 42 Water efficiency manual. </p>

<p class="doctitle">Water Quality.</p>
<p>Monitor water quality in the cooling tower periodically. Cleansing cooling tower basin, installing filters on side stream taken from cooling tower basin are examples of some recommended measures. Bacterial growths such as Legionella are known to have health concerns due to poor water quality. Controlling sunlight exposure inside the tower surface can significantly reduce biological growth.
