<p>
    <ul class="mylist">
        <li><b>Modulate the quantity of combustion air:</b> Excess or deficiency of air should be avoided by periodically checking the air-to-fuel ratio. Refer to the <a class="doctitle" href="http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2014/05/f16/check_burner_air2.pdf" , target="_blank">Check Burner Air-to-Fuel Ratio </a> tipsheet </a></li>
        <li><b>Clean scale and soot formation in the boiler:</b> Scale and soot formation act as an insulator, reducing heat transfer efficiency and increasing flue gas exhaust temperature.</li>
        <li><b>Install waste heat recovery:</b> Waste heat recovery should be installed after ensuring that the boiler is cleaned and tuned. For more details, refer to section 3.0, Waste Heat Recovery Options and Technologies, in the <a class="doctitle" href="https://www1.eere.energy.gov/manufacturing/intensiveprocesses/pdfs/waste_heat_recovery.pdf" , target="_blank">Waste Heat Recovery: Technology and Opportunities in U.S. Industry</a> report by the U.S. Department of Energy. </li>
        <li><b>Reduce blowdown cycles and recover waste heat from blowdown:</b> Determine boiler blowdown cycle by considering boiler type, operating pressure, water treatment, and quality of make-up water. Consider an automatic blowdown control system. Refer to the <a class="doctitle" href="https://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2014/05/f16/steam9_blowdown.pdf" , target="_blank">Minimize Boiler Blowdown <a> tip sheet for more details</li>
        <li><b>Preheat combustion air: </b> Wherever possible, consider designing the flue exhaust gas duct such that the heat can be used to preheat the incoming combustion air. Refer to the <a class="doctitle" href="http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2014/05/f16/et_preheated.pdf " , target="_blank">Preheated Combustion Air</a> tipsheet for more details</li>
    </ul>
    Refer to section 9.2, Boilers, in the <a class="doctitle" href="http://www.pnnl.gov/main/publications/external/technical_reports/PNNL-19634.pdf" , target="_blank">Operations &amp; Maintenance Best Practices</a> document .

<div class="myh3">Modular boilers versus large boiler design</div>
<p>
    A common challenge engineers face is choosing a boiler configuration for the heating system. Typically, heating systems have two boilers, one to meet the heating load and a second as a backup in case the first boiler fails. Alternatively, multiple small boilers can be installed with redundancy. Such a configuration is called modular boiler system.
