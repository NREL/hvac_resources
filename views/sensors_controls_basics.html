<p>Sensors are the backbone of control systems; they let us “see” and control large complex systems through the building automation systems (BAS). A BAS may have hundreds to thousands of sensor and control points all relying on accurate information to function optimally. Faulty sensors can lead to improper functionality and may lead to wasted energy, poor indoor environmental conditions, and maybe even to running equipment to failure. Sensors are used to measure temperature, relative humidity, CO2, water flow, air flow, pressure, levels, energy consumption, and more. All sensors need to be properly specified, installed, commissioned, and maintained in order to provide the expected accuracy of the expected measurement points.</p>

<p>Automated control systems are necessary to keep our building systems operating. They can be as simple as a single thermostat or complicated control systems for operation and optimization of large HVAC systems. The large control systems interact with a vast number of sensors and actuators to monitor systems and maintain performance. Maintaining and optimizing these control systems can be a full time job, but the benefits are usually worth the investment. Modern control systems offer additional features such as dynamic optimization routines, automated fault detection and diagnostics, remote monitoring, automated demand response, and cloud based analytics.  </p>
