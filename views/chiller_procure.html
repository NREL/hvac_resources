<span class="myh2">Procurement and Performance Specifications</span>

<p>Chiller procurement specification is an important aspect of overall central plant design because it is a step at which energy-efficient design intent translates to procurement of an actual energy-efficient chiller. The <a href="http://www.taylor-engineering.com/Websites/taylorengineering/images/guides/EDR_DesignGuidelines_CoolToolsChilledWater.pdf#page=177" target="_blank">Chilled Water Plant Design Guide </a> provides some useful chiller procurement tips in Chapter 7. It recommends basing the initial interaction with the vendor on total tonnage and not mentioning the number of chillers, chiller size, chiller efficiency, and variable frequency or fixed speed drives. This is mainly to encourage multiple options from the vendor. Recommended performance specification information includes total plant tonnage, minimum number of chillers or required level of redundancy, design entering and leaving evaporator and condenser water temperature, and available sources of energy (thermal/gas/electricity). Pressure drop through the chiller bundles will impact the pumping power required and should be considered when reviewing total system energy use. </p>

<p>The vendor should also be given the anticipated cooling load profile showing the number of hours at various conditions so they can recommend a chiller configuration based on that information. Depending on the project, design constraints such as mechanical room space, electrical power availability, type of refrigerant, and acoustics need to be identified and clearly outlined in the specification.

  Utility incentives can help pay down the cost of higher efficiency equipment. Chiller suppliers should know about available incentives in a given area, but it is always best to confirm incentives with a utility representative. The <a class="doctitle" href="http://www.dsireusa.org/" target="_blank" >DSIRE database </a> gives an overview of state incentives for renewables and energy efficiency measures.</p>
