<div class="myh2">Procurement and Performance Specifications</div>

<p>Chiller procurement specification is an important aspect of overall central plant design as it is a step where energy efficient design intent needs to translate in to procurement of actual energy efficient chiller. <a href="http://www.taylor-engineering.com/Websites/taylorengineering/images/guides/EDR_DesignGuidelines_CoolToolsChilledWater.pdf#page=177" target="_blank">The Chilled Water Plant Design Guide</a> gives some useful tips in chapter 7 for chiller procurement. It recommends basing initial interaction with vendor based on total tonnage and not mentioning number of chillers, chiller size, chiller efficiency and VFD/ fixed speed. This is mainly to encourage multiple options from a vendor. Recommended information for performance specification is total plant tonnage, minimum number of chillers or required level of redundancy, design entering and leaving evaporator and condenser water temperature, available sources of energy (thermal/gas/electricity). Pressure drop through the chiller bundles will impact pumping power required and should be considered when reviewing total system energy use.</p>

<p>The vendor should also be given the anticipated cooling load profile showing the number of hours at various conditions so that they can recommend the chiller configuration
  based on it. Depending on the project, design constraints such as mechanical room space, electrical power availability, type of refrigerant and acoustics need to be identified
  and clearly outlined in the specification. Lastly the Chilled Water Plant Design Guide recommends ensuring accessories and additional charges such as freight are included in the
  pricing of the options. Utility incentives can help pay down the cost of higher efficiency equipment.  Chiller suppliers should know available incentives in a given area, but it is
  always best to confirm incentives with a utility representative. The <a class="doctitle" href="http://www.dsireusa.org/" target="_blank" >DSIRE database </a> gives an overview of state incentives for renewables and efficiency measures.</p>
