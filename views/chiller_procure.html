<div class="myh2">Procurement and Performance Specifications</div>

<p>Chiller procurement specification is an important aspect of overall central plant design as it is a step where energy efficient design intent needs to translate in to procurement of actual energy efficient chiller.</p>


<p><a class="doctitle" href="http://www.taylor-engineering.com/Websites/taylorengineering/images/guides/EDR_DesignGuidelines_CoolToolsChilledWater.pdf" target="_blank">The Chilled Water Plant Design Guide</a> (by Energy Design Resources) gives some useful tips in <a href="http://www.taylor-engineering.com/Websites/taylorengineering/images/guides/EDR_DesignGuidelines_CoolToolsChilledWater.pdf#page=177" target="_blank">chapter 7</a> for chiller procurement. It recommends basing initial interaction with vendor based on total tonnage and not mentioning number of chillers, chiller size, chiller efficiency and VFD/ fixed speed. This is mainly to encourage multiple options from a vendor. Recommended information for performance specification is total plant tonnage, minimum number of chillers or required level of redundancy, design entering and leaving temperature, available sources of energy (gas/electricity).</p> 

<p>The vendor should also be given the cooling load profile so that they can recommend the chiller configuration based on it. Depending on the project, design constraints such as mechanical room space, electrical power availability, type of refrigerant and acoustics need to be identified and clearly outlined in the specification. Lastly the Chilled Water Plant Design Guide recommends ensuring accessories and additional charges such as freight are included in the pricing of the options.</p>
