<tr>
  <th rowspan="4">Metallic Duct</th>
  <th>Galvanized Steel</th>
  <td>Used in air handling system supply and return ducts</td>
  <td>Strong, rigid, durable, rust-resistant, easy to work (i.e., drill holes, weld, and paint)</td>
  <td>Poor acoustics, can transmit noise due to vibration; cannot be used in corrosive environment and to handle high temperature fluid</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <th>Carbon Steel</th>
  <td>High temperature duct systems and ducts requiring paint or special coating (flues, stacks, and hoods) </td>
  <td>Sturdy, rigid, durable, easily available, weldable. and nonporous </td>
  <td>Gets corroded quickly, heavyweight</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <th>Aluminum</th>
  <td>Clean room, moist air, exhausts</td>
  <td>Lightweight, corrosion-resistant, lower static friction drop compared to galvanized steel</td>
  <td>Low strength, expensive compared to galvanized steel, difficult to weld </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <th>Stainless Steel </th>
  <td>Kitchen exhaust, moist air, fume exhaust </td>
  <td>Corrosion-resistant, can take high polish </td>
  <td>Difficult to work (i.e., drill holes, bend), expensive compared to galvanized steel </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <th rowspan="4">Non metallic Duct</th>
  <th>Fiberglass- Reinforced Plastic </th>
  <td>Chemical exhausts, scrubbers, underground duct systems</td>
  <td>Good sound attenuation, corrosion-resistant</td>
  <td>High cost, weight, fabrication, code acceptance</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <th>Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) </th>
  <td>Exhaust for chemical fumes and underground duct work </td>
  <td>Corrosion-resistant, lightweight, easy to work (weld and modify) </td>
  <td>High cost, inability to handle thermal shock </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <th>Polyvinyl Steel (PVS)</th>
  <td>Ducts, moist air environments</td>
  <td>Corrosion-resistant, lightweight</td>
  <td>Inability to withstand high temperatures, prone to coating damage</td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <th>Flexible Duct</th>
  <td>Run outs, used to connect supply plenum to diffuser </td>
  <td>Factory-insulated, fewer duct connections and joints</td>
  <td>Can get easily torn and crushed, high resistance to airflow</td>
</tr>

<tr>
    <th>Round</th>
    <td rowspan="3">Air distribution</td>
    <td>Smaller pressure drop per unit area, high ratio of air-carrying capacity to pressure drop, less leakage compared to rectangular duct </td>
    <td>Height cannot be adjusted, needs a fixed amount of clear space</td>
</tr>

<tr>
    <th>Rectangular</th>
    <td>Easy fabrication, can fit into tight spaces, provides flat surface for tap-ins</td>
    <td>Higher pressure drop, uses more material compared to a round duct for same airflow, difficult to seal</td>
</tr>

<tr>
    <th>Oval</th>
    <td>Smaller height requirement compared to a round duct</td>
    <td>Fittings are difficult to fabricate, difficult to handle and ship large sizes</td>
</tr>
