<p>Thermal Energy Storage (TES) is a method of storing heating or cooling thermal energy by running equipment at off-peak hours or at other times when free or low cost energy is available. Ice, water and phase change material are some commonly used storage media. Cool storage systems are most suitable in applications where:
<li>Peak total cooling load of the facility is significantly higher than the average load</li>
<li>Utilityâ€™s electric rate structure has high demand charges, ratchet charges or a significant difference between on-peak and off- peak rates</li>
<li>Facility is considering expanding cooling capacity</li>
<li>An existing storage tank is available</li>
<li>Redundancy in cooling systems is needed to make up for short term cooling requirement</li>
Refer the Thermal Energy Storage Strategies for Commercial HVAC systems  by PG&E for further information.
