<p>Thermal energy storage is a method of storing heating or cooling thermal energy by running equipment at off-peak hours. Ice, water, and phase change material
  are some commonly used storage media. Cool storage systems are most suitable for applications in which:
   <ul>
   <li>Peak total cooling load of the facility is significantly higher than the average load</li>
   <li>Utilityâ€™s electric rate structure has high demand charges, ratchet charges, or a significant difference between on-peak and off-peak rates </li>
   <li>Facility is considering expanding cooling capacity  </li>
   <li>An existing storage tank is available </li>
   <li>Redundancy in cooling systems is needed to make up for short-term cooling requirement.</li>
  </ul>
