<div class="myh2">Operation and Training Resources</div>

<p>Proper operation of a chiller includes periodic maintenance and ongoing monitoring of performance. Some steps suggested to ensure efficient chiller operation are:
<p class="myh3">Annual chiller inspection, check for:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Refrigerant and air leaks (Check low-pressure systems for excess air and high-pressure systems for appropriate refrigerant levels)</li>
    <li>Compressor operating pressures</li>
    <li>Motor voltage and amps (Look out for increases in current draw</li>
    <li>Electrical starters, contactors and relays</li>
    <li>Evaporator and condenser tube bundle cleanliness and integrity</li>
    </ul>
<br>
<span class="myh3">Performance Indicators</span>
<ul>
    <li>Condenser and evaporator entering and leaving water temperature and flow</li>
    <li>Chiller load profile</li>
    <li>Chiller energy performance (kW/Ton)</li>
    <li>Oil level and pressure</li>
  </ul>
