<p>Proper operation of a chiller includes periodic maintenance and monitoring of performance. Few steps suggested to ensure efficient chiller operation are:</p>
<p class="myh3">Annual Chiller Inspection</p>
Check for
<p>	&middot; Refrigerant and air leak (Check low-pressure systems for excess air and high-pressure systems for appropriate refrigerant levels)
<p>	&middot; Compressor operating pressures</p>
<p>	&middot; Motor voltage and amps (Look out for increases in current draw)</p>
<p>	&middot; Electrical starters, contactors and relays</p>
<p class="myh3">Performance Indicators</p>
<p>	&middot; Condenser and evaporator entering and leaving water temperature</p>
<p>	&middot; Chiller load profile</p>
<p>	&middot; Oil level and pressure</p>

<p>For additional information on each of the above efficiency measure, refer section 7.4.6. Maintenance of chillers in the Operations and Maintenance Best Practices guide by PNNL, published by U.S. DOE and Chapter 6 in the Energy-Related Best Practices sourcebook published by Iowa State.</p>
