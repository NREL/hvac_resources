<div class="myh2">Chiller: Operation and Training Resources</div>

<p>Proper operation of a chiller includes periodic maintenance and ongoing performance monitoring. Here are some steps to ensure efficient chiller operation.
    <p class="myh3">During the annual chiller inspection, check for:</p>
    <ul class="mylist">
        <li>Refrigerant and air leaks &lpar;check low-pressure systems for excess air and high-pressure systems for appropriate refrigerant levels&rpar;</li>
        <li>Compressor operating pressures</li>
        <li>Motor voltage and amps &lpar;look for increases in current draw&rpar;</li>
        <li>Issues with electrical starters, contactors, and relays</li>
        <li>Evaporator and condenser tube bundle cleanliness and integrity.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <span class="myh3">Performance Indicators include:</span>
    <ul class="mylist">
        <li>Condenser and evaporator entering and leaving water temperature and flow</li>
        <li>Chiller load profile</li>
        <li>Chiller energy performance &lpar;kW/ton&rpar;</li>
        <li>Oil level and pressure.</li>
    </ul>
