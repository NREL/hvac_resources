    <br>An air handler condensate recovery system was installed to capture condensate, which was routed to cooling tower as make-up water. The system saved 540,000 gallons of water in 8 months.</p>

    <br>Heat exchangers were cleaned to eliminate scaling and bio-fouling, which allowed for an increase in cycles of concentration from 2.5 to 5.7. This maintenance measure resulted in water savings of 821,300 gallons ($5,650) and electricity savings of 434,900 kWh ($27,399) in 8 months.</p>
