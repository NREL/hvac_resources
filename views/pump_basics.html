<span class="myh2">Pump: Basics</span>

<p>A pump is a mechanical device used to move fluid. Its typical application in a central plant is to move chilled or hot water and condenser water through the loop.
    Booster or secondary pumps are sometimes used in individual buildings to supplement the pump at the central plant. The most commonly used pump for central plant
    applications is the centrifugal pump. </p>

Pumps are broadly classified as end suction and inline pumps. For further classification of both these pump types, refer to the
<a class="doctitle" href="https://www.pseau.org/outils/ouvrages/grundfos_pump_handbook_2004.pdf" target="_blank">Pump Handbook</a> from Grundfos Industry.

<div class="transimg">
    <img class="myimage" src="img/pump_types.png" alt="Image shows most common end-suction and in-line pump types. End suction to horizontal, then it separates to either single-stage or multistage. Single stage has long-coupled or close-coupled. Multistage has only close-coupled. End-suction pump=the liquid runs directly into the impeller, inlet and outlet have a 90 degree angle. In-line pump=the liquid runs directly through the pump in-line. The suction pipe and the discharge pipe are placed opposite one another and can be mounted directly in the piping system. Split-case pump=pump with axially divided pump housing. Horizontal pump= pump with horizontal pump shaft. Vertical pump= pump with vertical pump shaft. Single-stage pump= pump with a single impeller. Multistage pump= pump with several series-coupled stages. Long-coupled pump= pump connected to the motor by emans of a flexible coupling. The motor and the pump have separate bearing constructions. Close-coupled pump= a pump connected to the motor by means of a rigid coupling.">

    <img class="myimage" src="img/pumps_inline.jpg" alt="In-line pumps are divided into two groups, horizontal and horizontal/vertical. The horizontal go to split-case, single-stage, and long-coupled. The horizontal/vertical divides into single-stage or multistage. The single stage divides to long-coupled or close-coupled. The Multistage goes to close-coupled.">
