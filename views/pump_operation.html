<p class="myh3">Pump maintenance</p>

<b>Why is pump maintenance important?</b>
<p>If the pump is not operating near its Best efficiency point (BEP), the power consumed will be high and disproportionate to the flow rate. Monitoring is recommended
  to identify such inefficiencies.</p>
<br>

<b>What is preventive, predictive and periodic maintenance of pumps?</b>
<p> &middot; Preventive action measures are those which are taken to prevent a pump from failing. It consists of coupling alignment, lubrication and seal maintenance and replacement.</p>
<p> &middot; Predictive action measures are those that help cover for unexpected equipment outage. Vibration analysis, motor current signature analysis, lubrication oil analysis, periodic efficiency testing are methods suggested under predictive actions.</p>
<p> &middot; Periodic maintenance checklist consists of checking for leakage from packing and mechanical seals; monitoring condition of bearings, evaluating motor/pump alignment and checking motor condition.</p>
