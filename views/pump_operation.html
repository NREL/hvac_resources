<p><span class="myh3">Pump Maintenance </span>
<br>
If the pump is not operating near its best efficiency point, the power consumed will be high and disproportionate to the flow rate. Monitoring is recommended to
identify such inefficiencies.</p>

<span class="myh3">Pump maintenance measures include:</span>
<ul>
<li>Preventive action measures: Measures taken to prevent a pump from failing, including coupling alignment, lubrication, and seal maintenance and replacement</li>
<li>Predictive action measures: Measures that help compensate for unexpected equipment outage, including vibration analysis, motor current signature analysis, lubrication oil analysis, and periodic efficiency testing</li>
<li>Periodic maintenance checklist: Checks of packing and mechanical seals for leakage, bearings for general condition, motors/pumps for alignment, and motors for general condition.</li>
</ul>
