<div class="myh2">General Description and Uses</div>

<p>Cooling tower is a heat rejection device and is used in HVAC and industrial applications. The hot water (generally at 95 °F) is made to flow through a fill media with air blowing over it. The heat from the condenser water is absorbed by the water and is released into the atmosphere. Cooling towers are used for HVAC applications where the cooled water (generally at 85 °F) is used to cool the hot refrigerant from the chiller. A supplementary water source known as ‘make up water’ is piped into the system to account for the evaporation and drift losses.</p>

<p>A few terms are commonly used in the industry while dealing with cooling towers. A list of such commonly used terms is given below.

<p><span class="myh3">Commonly Used Terms</span></p>

<p><span class="doctitle">Drift:</span> Water lost to the atmosphere due to misting.</p> 

<p><span class="doctitle">Make-up water:</span> Supplementary water added into the system to account for losses due to drift, evaporation, blow down and leakage.</p> 

<p><span class="doctitle">Total Dissolved Solids (TDS):</span> Sum total of organic inorganic material dissolved in the cooling water. Generally measured in ppmw or mg/L.</p>

<p><span class="doctitle">Blow down/bleed:</span> Water released from the recirculating water system in order to reduce the concentration of dissolved solids.</p> 

<p><span class="doctitle">Drift Eliminators:</span> Baffled device through which the air has to pass before leaving the cooling tower so that the water entrained in the air is collected.</p>  

<p><span class="doctitle">Approach:</span> Difference between leaving cold water temperature and the ambient air wet-bulb temperature (WBT) or entering water WBT.</p> 

<p><span class="doctitle">Cells Cycle of concentration (C.O.C):</span> Concentration of total dissolved solids (TDS) in the blow down water to the make-up water.</p>
