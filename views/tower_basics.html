<div class="myh2">General Description and Uses</div>

<p>Cooling towers are heat rejection devices used to cool and condense the hot refrigerant gas from commercial HVAC chiller compressors. Cooling towers use evaporative
  cooling to provide cooling approaching the ambient wet bulb temperature instead of the ambient dry bulb temperature, which provides improved chiller performance. Cooling
  tower performance is determined by a balance of energy and water consumption of the cooling tower and the chilled water plant. Proper water maintenance is important for optimal
  performance. </p>

<p>A few terms are commonly used in the industry while dealing with cooling towers. A list of such commonly used terms is given below.

<p><span class="myh3">Commonly Used Terms</span></p>

<p class="doctitle">Drift</p>
<p>Water lost to the atmosphere due to misting.</p>
<br>
<p class="doctitle">Make-up water</p>
<p>Supplementary water added into the system to account for losses due to drift, evaporation, blow down and leakage.</p>
<br>
<p class="doctitle">Total Dissolved Solids (TDS)</p>
<p>Sum total of organic inorganic material dissolved in the cooling water. Generally measured in ppmw or mg/L.</p>
<br>
<p class="doctitle">Blow down/bleed</p>
<p>Water released from the recirculating water system in order to reduce the concentration of dissolved solids.</p>
<br>
<p class="doctitle">Drift Eliminators</p>
<p>Baffled device through which the air has to pass before leaving the cooling tower so that the water entrained in the air is collected.</p>
<br>
<p class="doctitle">Approach</p>
<p>Difference between leaving cold water temperature and the ambient air wet-bulb temperature (WBT) or entering water WBT.</p>
<br>
<p class="doctitle">Cells Cycle of concentration (C.O.C)</p>
<p>Concentration of total dissolved solids (TDS) in the blow down water to the make-up water.</p>
