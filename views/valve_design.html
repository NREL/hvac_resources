<span class="myh3">Valve Sizing Considerations</span>
<br>
<p>The
  <a class="doctitle" href="http://www.taylor-engineering.com/Websites/taylorengineering/images/guides/EDR_DesignGuidelines_CoolToolsChilledWater.pdf " target="_blank"
  >Chilled Water Plant Design Guide </a> has a detailed section on valve selection criteria. Rules of thumb play a significant role in valve design. One example of a rule
  of thumb is that if a valve is sized to operate between 60% and 80% open at maximum flow and not less than 20% open at minimum flow, it yields the best flow control
  result (Source: <a class="doctitle" href="http://www.valin.com/resources/blog/rules-thumb-techniques-and-considerations-properly-sizing-control-valves" target="_blank"
  >Valin</a>).</p>

<p> Few important valve sizing considerations from the <a class="doctitle" href="http://www.taylor-engineering.com/Websites/taylorengineering/images/guides/EDR_DesignGuidelines_CoolToolsChilledWater.pdf#page=128 " target="_blank">Chilled Water Plant Design Guide </a> are listed below. Refer to section 5, pages 14–17 for more details.
<ul class="mylist">
        <li>Determine <b>valve pressure drop</b> such that it is a significant portion of the overall system pressure drop. Oversized valves will cause large flow variations with small change in valve position, while an undersized valve will introduce a large pressure drop.</li>
        <li>Select valve based on pressure drop and <b>valve flow coefficient (Cv)</b>.</li>
        <li>Estimate number of <b>actuation cycles</b> each valve is likely to be subjected to in a year. </li>
        <li>Clearly specify <b>operational environment</b> and performance requirements of each valve.</li>
        <li>Check for <b>close-off pressure capability</b>, especially for gate valves.</li>
        <li>Wherever possible, purchase <b>control valve and actuator as one unit.</b></li>

<span class="myh3"> Valve Insulation </span>
<p>
Prevention of heat loss through valves is important on steam, hot water, and cold water lines. Valves are also insulated as a safety measure on steam lines. Refer to the
U.S. Department of Energy Tip Sheet #17: <a class="doctitle" href="https://www1.eere.energy.gov/manufacturing/tech_assistance/pdfs/steam17_valves_fittings.pdf" target="_blank">Installing Removable Insulation on Valves and Fittings</a>. The document includes a table that gives energy savings in Btu/hr for different valve sizes
across operating temperatures ranging from 200°–600°F.
