<p class="myh3">Valve Sizing Considerations</p>
<p>The <a class="doctitle" href="http://www.taylor-engineering.com/Websites/taylorengineering/images/guides/EDR_DesignGuidelines_CoolToolsChilledWater.pdf " target="_blank">Chilled water plant design guide </a> has a detailed section on valve selection criteria. Rules of thumb play a significant role in valve design. One
  example of a rule of thumb is that if a valve is sized to operate between 60 -80% open at max flow and not less than 20% open at minimum flow, it yields
   the best flow control result
   (Souce: <a class="doctitle" href="http://www.valin.com/resources/blog/rules-thumb-techniques-and-considerations-properly-sizing-control-valves " target="_blank">Valin corporation</a>).</p>

<p> Few important valve sizing considerations from the <a class="doctitle" href="http://www.taylor-engineering.com/Websites/taylorengineering/images/guides/EDR_DesignGuidelines_CoolToolsChilledWater.pdf " target="_blank">Chilled water plant design guide </a> are listed below. Refer section 5-14 for more details.

<p>	&middot; Determine valve pressure drop such that it is a significant portion of the overall system pressure drop. Oversized valve will cause large flow variations with small change in valve position while an undersized valve will introduce a large pressure drop.</p>
<p>	&middot; Select valve based on pressure drop and valve flow coefficient Cv. </p>
<p>	&middot; Estimate number of actuation cycles each valve is likely to be subjected in a year. </p>
<p>	&middot; Clearly specify operational environment and performance requirements of each valve.</p>
<p>	&middot; Check for close-off capability especially for gate valves.</p>
<p>	&middot; Wherever possible, purchase control valve and actuator as one unit.</p>

<p class="myh3"> Valve insulation </p>
<p>  Prevention of heat loss through valves is important on steam, hot water and cold water lines. Valves are also insulated as a safety measure on steam lines.
  Refer this <a class="doctitle" href="https://www1.eere.energy.gov/manufacturing/tech_assistance/pdfs/steam17_valves_fittings.pdf  " target="_blank">DOE tip sheet </a> on installing removable insulation on valves and fittings. The document includes a table which gives energy savings in Btu/hr for different
   valve sizes across operating temperature ranging from 200 °F – 600 °F. </p>
