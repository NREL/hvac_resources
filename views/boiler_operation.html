<span class="myh2">Boiler: Operation and Training Resources</span>

<p>Periodic boiler evaluation is required to ensure that the boiler is operating as designed. The boilers section of the <a class="doctitle" href="https://dehumidifiercritic.com/ftguide/" target="_blank">Functional Testing Guide</a> gives detailed guidance on steps to perform a functional test of boilers. It also estimates the time required to carry out the testing and links to various checklists for boiler commissioning. </p>
<p class="myh3">Example of actions that need special attention during the testing process include:</p>

<ul class="mylist">
    <li>Verifying proper boiler staging under normal operation, failure, and emergency modes; proper coordination between boiler staging and load variation will save energy</li>
    <li>Verifying boiler starts/stops with the time delay specified during design</li>
    <li>Verifying that all control loops stabilize within a reasonable time (typically 2–5 minutes) after a significant load change.</li>
</ul>

<p>Refer to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s <a class="doctitle" href="https://www.energystar.gov/sites/default/files/buildings/tools/BoilerTune-Up_Benefits.pdf" target="_blank">Boiler Tune-Ups fact sheet</a> for a detailed list of boiler systems energy efficiency measures.</p>
