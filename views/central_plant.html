<div class="myh1">CENTRAL PLANT</div>

<p>Chilled Water Central Plants are typically comprised of chiller(s), chiller water pump(s), condenser water pump(s), cooling tower(s), water treatment systems,
  controls, and energy metering.  Typically, chilled water central plants supply systems with cooling loads in excess of 50 tons that can range from one building to
  an array of buildings.  The use of cooling towers versus air cooled condensers, found in smaller standalone HVAC systems, can save energy by using wet bulb temperatures
  versus dry bulb temperatures to reject heat from the cooling system.  The added components in these systems add to the complexity of operations and a higher level of
  operator knowledge and control oversight than that of standalone HVAC systems.</p>
