<p>The key opportunities for improving efficiency of pump operation are during design, retrofit and replacement. Design and replacement approach is similar since a
  new pump is being designed and installed. Retrofit opportunities are when efforts are made to improve efficiency of an existing system. Oversized pumps, inefficient motors,
   and constant speed pumps in applications with variable loads are some common design problems. A <a class="doctitle" href="http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2014/05/f16/pumplcc_1001.pdf" target="_blank">study published by the State Government of Victoria </a> lists 7 steps to improve
   efficiency of existing system:</p>

<p class="myh3">The same study identifies 5 areas to think about while designing a new system</p>
<p>1.	Assessing production requirements and minimizing pumping needs</p>
<p>2.	Designing with a whole-system approach</p>
<p>3.	Designing efficient pump stations</p>
<p>4.	Selecting efficient pumping components</p>
<p>5.	Improving design through iterations</p>

<p>For a detailed explanation of each step, refer to <a class="doctitle" href="http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2014/05/f16/pumplcc_1001.pdf" target="_blank">Energy Efficiency Best Practice Guide Pumping Systems</a> published by the State of Victoria.</p>

<p>Selecting an energy efficient centrifugal pump needs a careful evaluation of the performance curve. In order to minimize pump energy consumption, it is recommended to select
   a pump such that the system curve intersects the pump curve within 20% of its BEP. For a more detailed explanation and example of pump selection refer to
   <a class="doctitle" href="http://www.publicpower.org/files/pdfs/pumpingsystemsselectenergyefficientcentrifugalpump.pdf" target="_blank">U.S. DOE Pumping Systems Tip Sheet #3</a>.</p>

       <blockquote>“Reducing the pump volume from a constant 100% to 60% reduces power required by almost 50%”</blockquote>

<p>Another key strategy that is widely used to make pumps run efficiently is installing Variable Frequency Drives to ramp down the pump speed at low loads. Existing hydronic systems
   often have three way control valves that will need to be replaced with two way control valves or have the bypass leg closed to allow for reduced flow at reduced loads.
   Typically, pumps operate at less than 60% load for almost 80% of their operating hours. Since the power is proportional to the cube of the shaft speed (affinity laws),
   a small reduction in speed has a significant reduction in power. Reducing the volume from a constant 100% to 60% reduces the electrical power required by almost 50%. (Source:

<p>However, there are many things that need to be considered while retrofitting VFD to an existing motor. For example, the requirement of an inverter duty motor for high
  voltage applications. The peak flow demand and annual load profile also need to be evaluated while comparing different pumping systems.

<p> Last, future load additions should be considered before finalizing pump selection. To avoid running the equipment at partial load, the design should be such that
   it can be upgraded easily. Planning space for such additions is strongly recommended. For more details about planning for future capacity increases,
   refer to Chapter 7, section 7.3.3.
