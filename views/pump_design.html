<span class="myh4">Efficient centrifugal pump selection</span>
<br>
Selecting an energy efficient centrifugal pump requires a careful evaluation of the pump and system curves. In order to minimize pump energy consumption, it is
  recommended to select a pump such that the system curve intersects the pump curve within 20% of its BEP. For a more detailed explanation and example of pump selection
  refer to the <a class="doctitle" href="http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2014/05/f16/efficient_centrifug_pumps.pdf " target="_blank"> U.S. DOE Pumping Systems Tip Sheet #3.</a>

<span class="myh4">Variable Speed Drives on pumps</span>
<br>
Existing hydronic systems often have 3 way control valves that will need to be replaced with 2 way control valves or have the bypass leg closed to allow reduced flow at
  reduced loads.  Some 3 way valves may not function properly with bypass leg closed if open leg wasn’t designed to close against higher pressure.  Typically, pumps operate at
   less than 60% load for almost 80% of the operating hours. Since the power is proportional to the cube of the shaft speed (affinity laws), a small reduction in speed has a
   significant reduction in power. (Source: <a class= "doctitle" href="http://www.sustainableplant.com/assets/Baldor/Baldor-0411-Pump-Energy-Savings-with-VFDs.pdf" target="_blank"

<br>
To avoid running the equipment at part load, the design should be such that it can be upgraded easily. Planning space for such additions is strongly recommended. For more
   details about planning for future capacity increases, refer to section ‘7.3.3. Plan for future capacity increases section’<a class="doctitle" href="http://www.ciras.iastate.edu/publications/EnergyBP-ChemicalIndustry/Sourcebook_Chapter7.pdf" target="_blank"> Pumps and Motors document.</a>
