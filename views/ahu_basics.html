<div class="myh2">General Description and Uses</div>

<p>Air handling units are devices to transfer heat between water/refrigerant and air and regulate the air supply throughout the building. The hot/cold water coming
  from the central plant passes through coils. The heating/cooling can also be provided directly by the refrigerant. Such a system is known as a DX air
  conditioning system. </p>

<p>A blow/draw through fan blows/draws air over the coils which then is circulated through the building via ducts. The AHU has an opening for return air (recirculated from the building)
  and outside air (fresh air in taken for ventilation purposes). An important component of the AHU is the filter. Some commonly used filters are fiberglass filter, polyester and
  pleated filters, high efficiency particulate arrestance (HEPA) filters and washable air filters. Filter effectiveness is rated based on the Minimum Energy Reporting Value (MERV).
  Higher the MERV rating, more effective is the filter i.e. it can contain finer particles. Filters with higher MERV rating have significantly high pressure drop compared to those
  with lower MERV. For more details about MERV ratings and application, refer this table from ANSI/ASHRAE table 52.2-2007. </p>
