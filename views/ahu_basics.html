<div class="myh2">General Description and Uses</div>

<p>Air handling units are devices to transfer heat between water/refrigerant and air and regulate the air supply throughout the building. The hot/cold water coming from
  the central plant passes through a row/s of coils. The heating/cooling can also be provided directly by the refrigerant. Such a system is known as a DX air conditioning system.
  They are not beneficial for large systems are refrigerant lines cannot be laid out for long distance. Coil maintenance plays a significant role in energy efficiency and IAQ
  performance. Proper maintenance, including coil cleaning can improve the energy efficiency by 10 – 15 %.</p>

<p>A blow/draw through fan blows air over the coils which then is circulated through the building via ducts. The AHU has an opening for return air (recirculated from the building) and outside air (fresh air in taken for ventilation purposes). An important component of the AHU is the filter. Some commonly used filters are fiberglass filter, polyester and pleated filters, high efficiency particulate arrestance (HEPA) filters and washable air filters. Filter effectiveness is rated based on the Minimum Energy Reporting Value (MERV). Higher the MERV rating, more effective is the filter i.e. it can contain finer particles. The choice of filter depends on the Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) requirement in the conditioned space. For example in cleanrooms where high IAQ is needed, HEPA filters (MERV >17) are used. For more details about MERV ratings and application, refer this table from ANSI/ASHRAE table 52.2-2007. Filters with higher MERV rating have significantly high pressure drop compared to those with lower MERV. The initial pressure drop of a MERV 11 filter is 0.2” while that of MERV 17 HEPA filter is around 1”. Thus higher MERV rating means greater fan energy is consumed.
