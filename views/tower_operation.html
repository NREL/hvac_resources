<p>Smooth cooling tower operation is achieved by paying close attention to safety and operational guidelines given by the manufacturer. Safety aspects include providing safe access and fall protection in all areas where any personnel is expected to go during inspection or maintenance, fan motor and condenser pump lock out during inspection, ensuring worker protection from biological growth and avoiding re-entry of discharge air.</p>

<p>Operational aspects to consider for a cooling tower are</p>
<div class="mylist">
<p>	&middot; Clearing debris and filling basin to required level with makeup water valve.</p>
<p>	&middot; Balancing water flow to ensure maximum wetness of fill surface area</p> 
<p>	&middot; Chemical treatment during startup</p>
<p>	&middot; Checking if fan is rotating in proper direction</p>
<p>	&middot; Setting appropriate blow down rate</p>
<p>	&middot; Installing and monitoring conductivity controllers to ensure correct blow down rate</p>
<p>	&middot; Keeping log of quantities of make-up and blow-down water. This helps in identifying leaks and unaccounted draw-offs.</p>
